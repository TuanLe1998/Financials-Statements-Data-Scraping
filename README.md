# Financials-Statements-Data-Scraping
In this project we will scrape financials statements data of a company from 3rd-party site and build a report in Power BI.
You can see the data from the 3rd-party site here

The tool and library we will be using in this project:
 - Python: pandas, bs4 and requests
 - Power BI

You only need to input the listing code of the company to the code and it will automatically generate a csv file contains information about financials statements of that company the last 4 quarter.
